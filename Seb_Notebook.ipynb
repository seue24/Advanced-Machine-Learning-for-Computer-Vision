    "- Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)\n",
    "    - Combines image structure, luminance, and contrast which are calculated locally for each pixel\n",
    "    - Variants: Multi-scale SSIM which calculates local luminance, contrast and structure additionally for four downscaled versions of the images and combines them in a weighted fashion\n",
    "                Complex-wavelet SSIM designed to compensate for small rotations and spatial translations\n",
    "    - Requires ground truth reference image for each output\n",
    " - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) \n",
    "    - developed to measure reconstruction quality of a lossy compressed image compared to the uncompressed reference image\n",
    "    - Often used as a metric for assessing image similarity\n",
    "    - requires ground truth reference image for each output so we can#t use it\n",
    "- Error metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, NMSE \n",
    "    - not really an option for us since they directly depend on the absolute difference of intensity values at equal pixel locations\n",
    "- Learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS)\n",
    "    - Passes images through a pretrained deep network and comparing their feature representations at multiple layers\n",
    "    - Relies on feature maps from a trained image classification model\n",
    "    - Computes difference between feature maps of image1 and image2 usually L2 difference channel-wise\n",
    "    - Adaption: Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) giving more focus on texture\n",
    "- Mutual information (MI) estimates the amount of information of an image R that can be predicted from image I\n",
    "    - Probably not suitable because we don#t want to retain information\n",
    "- Frechet Inception Distance (FID)\n",
    "    - Evaluates the distance between the generated images and real images in the feature space\n",
    "    - Widely used in GAN papers including unpaired translation works\n",
    "- Kernel Inception Distance (KID)\n",
    "    - Distribution divergence metric between generated and real images like FID\n",
    "    - Computes the maximum mean discrepancy in feature space which is a measure of how different two sets of samples are using a kernel function ondeep features\n",
    "- Inception Score\n",
    "    - Inception evaluates quality and diversity of a set of generated images without using any real images\n",
    "    - One of the earliest GAN metrics\n",
    "- NIQE\n",
    "    - Builds a model of Natural Scene Statistics from a corpus of natural images and then computes statistical features\n",
    "    - When evaluating a test image, NIQE extracts the same features and compares them to the model of natural image features\n",
    "- BRISQUE Blind/referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator \n",
    "    - Also relies on Natural Scene Statistics but unlike NIQE which is completly unsupervised BRISQUE was developed as a distortion-generic but trained model\n",
    "    - Computes a set of features from locally normalized luminance patches of the image and these feature capture deviations like blurring noise etc by quantifying loss of naturalness in luminance patterns\n",
    "    - BRISQUE then uses a regression modelto map these features to a quality score\n",
    "- Precision and Recall for Generative models\n",
    "- Human evaluation"
